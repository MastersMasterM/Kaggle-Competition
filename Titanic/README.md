First of all since both training set and test set (train.csv,test.csv) contain null values, We should deal with this problem.

In Filling_Na.ipynb the problem is solved with using several techniques such as using median,mean and clustring to fill na I think I provived enough information in the notebook.If you need more information contact me :)

In Model.ipynb I tried 10 diffrent classification algorithms(by using sklearn) I also trained an artificial neural network and compared cross validation scores with eachother and then chose the best model and pridicted values

In Tuned_ANN.ipynb I tried to tuned the ANN which I trained in Model.ipynb by using learning rate decay,then I faced with overfitting problem and overcame it by using a dropout layer

Thanks for your attention!
