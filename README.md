Hi my name is Mahdi, I'm a bachelor student and want to become a professional data sciencentist in near future.So I come up with this idea that it would be great if I do projects and share them with you.
I will upload my notebooks with tips that I would learn during the Kaggle competitions
Thanks for your attention :)
